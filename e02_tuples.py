'''Tuple
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

Example
Create a Tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)


'''Access Tuple Items
You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:

Example
Print the second item in the tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])


'''Negative Indexing
Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

Example
Print the last item of the tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[-1])


'''Range of Indexes
You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.

Example
Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[2:5])


'''Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).

Remember that the first item has index 0.'''

'''Range of Negative Indexes
Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the tuple:

Example
This example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[-4:-1])


'''Change Tuple Values
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

Example
Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:'''

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)


'''Loop Through a Tuple
You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.

Example
Iterate through the items and print the values:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
    print(x)


'''Check if Item Exists
To determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword:

Example
Check if "apple" is present in the tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
if "apple" in thistuple:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")


'''Tuple Length
To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() method:

Example
Print the number of items in the tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))


'''Add Items
Once a tuple is created, you cannot add items to it. Tuples are unchangeable.

Example
You cannot add items to a tuple:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
thistuple[3] = "orange" # This will raise an error
print(thistuple)


'''Create Tuple With One Item
To create a tuple with only one item, you have add a comma after the item, unless Python will not recognize the variable as a tuple.

Example
One item tuple, remember the commma:'''

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))


'''Remove Items
Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.

Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can delete the tuple completely:

Example
The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:'''

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists


'''Join Two Tuples
To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator:

Example
Join two tuples:'''

tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

'''The tuple() Constructor
It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

Example
Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:'''

thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)


'''Tuple Methods
Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

Method	Description
count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found'''
