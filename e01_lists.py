'''List
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.

Example
Create a List:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

'''
Access Items
You access the list items by referring to the index number:

Example
Print the second item of the list:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])

'''Negative Indexing
Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

Example
Print the last item of the list:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])


'''Range of Indexes
You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

This is called the slice operator

Example
Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])
print(thislist)
print(thislist[-4:-1])

'''Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).

Remember that the first item has index 0.

By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:

Example
This example returns the items from the beginning to "orange":'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])
print(thislist[:-3])


'''By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:

Example
This example returns the items from "cherry" and to the end:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:])
print(thislist[-3:])

'''Range of Negative Indexes
Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:

Example
This example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])

'''Change Item Value
To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
Example
Change the second item:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)


'''Loop Through a List
You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:

Example
Print all items in the list, one by one:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
    print(x)

for x in range(len(thislist)):
    print(x)
    print(thislist[x])

'''
Check if Item Exists
To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:

Example
Check if "apple" is present in the list:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")


'''List Length
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

Example
Print the number of items in the list:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))


'''Add Items
To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

Example
Using the append() method to add an item:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)


'''To add an item at the specified index, use the insert() method:

Example
Insert an item as the second position:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)


'''Remove Item
There are several methods to remove items from a list:

Example
The remove() method removes the specified item:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)

'''Example
The pop() method removes the specified index, (or the last item if index is not specified):'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop()
print(thislist)

'''Example
The del keyword removes the specified index:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)


'''Example
The del keyword can also delete the list completely:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist


'''Example
The clear() method empties the list:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.clear()
print(thislist)


'''Copy a List
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().

Example
Make a copy of a list with the copy() method:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)


'''Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().

Example
Make a copy of a list with the list() method:'''

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)


'''Join Two Lists
There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.

One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.

Example
Join two list:'''

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)


'''Another way to join two lists are by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one:

Example
Append list2 into list1:'''

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
    list1.append(x)

print(list1)


'''Or you can use the extend() method, which purpose is to add elements from one list to another list:

Example
Use the extend() method to add list2 at the end of list1:'''

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

'''The list() Constructor
It is also possible to use the list() constructor to make a new list.

Example
Using the list() constructor to make a List:'''

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)


'''List Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.

clear()	    Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	    Returns a copy of the list

insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	    Removes the element at the specified position
